 OpenStack User Committee Charter
=================================

Mission
=======
The User Committee’s (“UC”) mission is to consolidate user’s requirements and
present these to the Technical Committee (“TC”) for their evaluation and
proper execution. It provides guidance for the development team where user
feedback is requested. The UC manages and coordinates both “working groups” and
“functional teams” to help them to become successful in their
individual goals and make a difference in the community. It keeps track of
OpenStack deployments and usage, helping to share user stories and
experiences. UC defines the expected activities from the users in order to be
recognized as active members and be granted with the AUC
(Active User Contributor) status. Finally, the UC works with user groups
worldwide to keep the community vibrant and informed.

User Committee Members
======================
The User Committee (UC) is comprised of at least three Individual Members,
one appointed by the Technical Committee, one appointed by the Board of
Directors, and one appointed by the appointees of the Technical Committee and
Board of Directors. The User Committee shall organize its meetings and may, on
approval of the Board of Directors, create elected seats to be filled by a
vote of the Individual Members recognized as AUC.

Active User Contributors
========================
Users are recognized as part of the community and therefore granted with
AUC (Active User Contributor) status when they have engaged in one or more of
the following activities:

* Organizers of Official OpenStack User Groups
* Active members and contributors to functional teams and/or working groups
* Moderators of any of the operators official meet-up sessions
* Contributors to any repository under the UC governance
* Track chairs for OpenStack summits
* Contributors to Superuser (articles, interviews, user stories, etc.)
* Active moderators on ask.openstack.org

UC Chair
========
The UC proposes one of its members to act as the UC chair. In the case of
multiple candidates, it may use a single-winner election method to decide the
result (see below). The Board of Directors has the authority to approve the UC
chair and shall approve the proposition, unless otherwise justified by its
bylaws. The UC chair is responsible for making sure meetings are held
according to the rules described below, and for communicating the decisions
taken during those meetings to the Board of Directors and the OpenStack
community at large. It may be revoked under the conditions described in the
OpenStack Foundation bylaws.

Structure - Functional Teams
============================
These are defined as permanent teams as long as they maintain a meaningful
mission in order to help the UC to achieve its mission. The work of the
functional teams is performed under the oversight of the UC. The functional
teams are listed in Teams.

Structure - Working Groups
==========================
These are defined as temporary teams with medium-short term goals and they will
exist until they have achieved those. The work of the working groups is
performed under the oversight of the UC.

Process for Creating a New Working Group/Functional Team
========================================================
* `Complete Working Group Template: <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Working_Group_Template>`_
* Join the user-committee mailing list and communicate your intention to start a
  new team to the User Committee via the same mailing list
* Mailing list: user-committee@lists.openstack.org
* Update UC wiki page with the entry for the new team. <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/UserCommittee>`_
* UC approves or denies the request before it becomes an active working
group or functional team

Meetings
========
UC meetings happen publicly, bi-weekly on IRC. The meeting times should be
decided among UC members. If there isn’t consensus on a meeting time, the
option of rotating the time weekly should be explored. The UC maintains an
open agenda on the wiki. The UC meeting is automatically called if anything
is posted to that wiki by one of its members at least one day before the
meeting time.  All functional team and working group leads are expected to
join or to send a representative at least quarterly with monthly preferred.
